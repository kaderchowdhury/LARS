I wish to apply for the role of 'Graduate Data Scientist', currently being advertised in glassdoor.co.uk. Please find my CV enclosed for your consideration. As you can see from the attached CV, I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Data Science from the University of Coventry. I believe I can apply my acquired knowledge such as database management systems,machine learning and Data Analysis to the company. I am a very enthusiastic, hard-working and creative person and I can contribute my skills to the company to progress and prosper. I believe I will be a valuable member of the Data Science team. 

I am an international student and my Tier-4 Student visa allows me to work in UK until January. I will be needing a Tier-2 visa afterwards, sponsored by the company in order to continue my role in the company.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to meeting with you to discuss my application further. 

Yours sincerely, 

Imran Kader Chowdhury
