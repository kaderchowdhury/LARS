The purpose of the project was to analyze user behavior associated to geolocations, in order to predict and recommend appropriate places for the user at a given context. I have used OpenStreetMap data for this experiment and the prediction and recommendation model has been built via Random Forest and Collaborative Filtering. The following OpenSourced projects has been used here:
